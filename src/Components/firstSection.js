          <p>
            I'm Yulia, a software developer with 2 years of experience and a
            background in graphic design. I have an eye for details and a keen
            understanding of how to craft interfaces that are both visually
            appealing and user-friendly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I gained my initial programming experience as a developer making
            significant contributions to a customer-facing portal of a
            sustainable energy delivery company to reach the MVP stage on a
            target date. Currently, I'm enhancing Wellbe, my personal mental
            health app project, to further learn new technologies and improve my
            technical skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Itâ€™s important to me to continuously learn and work on projects that
            make a meaningful impact on people's lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hold a residence permit that allows me to work in the Netherlands
            and the EU. Let's connect!
