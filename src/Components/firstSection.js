            I have an eye for details and a keen understanding of how to craft
            interfaces that are both visually appealing and user-friendly.

            I gained my initial programming experience as a developer making
            significant contributions to a customer-facing portal of a
            sustainable energy delivery company to reach the MVP stage on a
            target date. Currently, I'm enhancing Wellbe,
            <span> my personal mental health app project,</span> to further
            learn new technologies and improve my technical skills.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Itâ€™s important to me to <span>continuously learn</span> and work on
            projects that make a meaningful impact on people's lives.
